Review and compare some text classification tecnniques.


"In any case, your review must have novel content that does not exist in any existing literature or webpages so that it would offer unique information/knowledge that others can learn from your review. So please make sure to check whether there is already a review on the topic before you devote time to complete a review. If you find an existing review on the topic, you may still write about the topic, but just need to make sure that you take a somewhat different perspective than the existing review or add new content on top of the existing review (i.e., extending it in some way).
